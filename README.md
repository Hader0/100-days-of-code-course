# 100-days-of-code-course

## Overview
This course aims at improving programming skills and mastering Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. The projects cut accross data science, automation, web development, games and apps!

## Introduction
The projects contained in this repository are of varying difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced.
They are arranged from Day 1 to Day 100

## Steps To Follow
**Detailed description and steps to follow for each projects are contained in the README file in each of the project directories.**
Generally, the following steps will apply to all projects.

- **Star** this repository.
- On the [100-Days-of-Code-Course](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/100-days-of-code-course.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

- Open the folder for the intended day
- Check existing scripts in the projects directory.
- Edit the code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
