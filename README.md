# 100-days-of-code-course

## Overview
This course aims at improving programming skills and mastering Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. The projects cut accross data science, automation, web development, games and apps!

## Introduction
The projects contained in this repository are of varying difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced.
They are arranged from Day 1 to Day 100

## Steps To Follow
Detailed description and steps to follow for each projects are contained in the README file in each of the project directories
Generally, the following steps will apply to all projects.

- Select a project to work on.
- Check existing scripts in the projects directory.
- **Star** this repository.
- On the [100-Days-of-Code-Course](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/100-days-of-code-course.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

- Edit the code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.

- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
