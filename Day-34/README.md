# Quizzler
Quizzler is a quiz app built by using tkinter and a trivia API.In this script,there are 10 questions, and there are only two possible answers: true or false.And the questions that is being answered here come from the open trivia database which contains loads of questions.So you don't have to make up the questions and can even select which category of questions you want and also how many questions you want and we're going to use this API to populate the questions in our quiz.
- Click on green  tick if you want to go for true and click on red button if you think the answer is false
- The background color of canvas turns red if player is wrong and green if player is right.
