# Pomodoro Timer App (Digital Work Stopwatch)
A project that builds a Pomodora app completely from scratch using tkinter.
- Figure the task you want to do 
- And then your timer sets to the 25 minutes while you work on the task And then after that, you take a short five-minute break.You do four of these 25-minute work sessions
So hopefully by creating this program,you're going to increase your productivity and you're going to have your own handy tool
