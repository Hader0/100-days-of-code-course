##  Tip Calculator

In this script a simple tip calculator is made which takes the following as input

1.The total bill amount without the tip

2.The percent of tip intended to give

3.The number of persons splitting the total bill with the bill .

And it generates a tip for each person.
Another function used was the `input()` and `title()` function.This project goes three steps further than the first line of code written by every programmer(Hello World).The working_with_variable file can be used to aid understanding.
