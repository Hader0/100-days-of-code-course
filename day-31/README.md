# Quizlet(Learn French using flashy)
 A script that creates a flashcard program to help you study and learn the most frequently used words in french(100 words in this project).
 - It shows you the front of a card that has a word in French and the player is meant  to enter the corresponding english word
 - If the player gets it right,player scores increases and the word is removed from words to learn
 - If the player does not get it right,the card is flipped to the back and the english translation of word is displayed to be reviewed

You can decide to retain old progress anytime you return to this program or start afresh.
